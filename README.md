# UnitySubstanceViewer
Substance Viewer for Unity3D

The code basically takes all the inputs from the sbsar file and automatically creates a gui and it allows the user to change the parameters in real time (depending on the resolution of course). It's been sitting on the hard drive for years. I hope it will be useful for someone. It is not completely finished as it is a hobby project.

Unity version: 2020.1.9f1

TODO
- some input types not implemented
- more test
- more beautiful method for importing presets
